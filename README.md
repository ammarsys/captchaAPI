# This repository is currently being remade

The new version comes with a lot of features and a prettier front end. Chip in by leaving a ‚≠ê & wait for the v2 version.

# Captcha API

A lightweight Captcha API made with Flask. This version is a new, fast and completely rewritten API, originally by Vixen, which was discontinued.

[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

The API is live at [PythonAnywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com/) (specifically, [here](https://captchaAPI.pythonanywhere.com/)). 
# Usage

### Wrappers

 - [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/essentials-captcha)
 - [Repository & Creator](https://github.com/SpeckyYT/essentials-captcha#readme)

### Manual Usage

Simply make a HTTP get request to the API endpoint and treat it like a JSON.

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://captchaAPI.pythonanywhere.com/api/img').json()

print(response["solution"], response["url"])
```

or, if you'd like a async request

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get('https://captchaAPI.pythonanywhere.com/api/img') as responseget:
            return await responseget.json()

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
response = loop.run_until_complete(main())
print(response["solution"], response["url"])
```
